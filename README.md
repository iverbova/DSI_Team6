This project is part of the Data Science Certificate program at the University of Torontoâ€™s Data Sciences Institute.


## Dataset

We are using the [Retail Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset), which contains transactional-level sales data including features such as date, product category, quantity, unit price, and revenue.

The raw dataset is stored in the `data/raw/` directory.
